# YouTube Clone
[Academic Project] - A video streaming SPA demonstrating competency in React, React-Router, Node, Express, APIs, in addition to other front-end fundamentals.

<h2>About</h2>

I created a full stack single page application, using React, Express, and Node.js. The video data, stream URL, and comments came from a designated API. The upload functionality exists for video title and description, but full functionality was not part of the project requirements.    
 
<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- Grasped React fundamentals, such as component lifecycle methods, using props and state, and JSX.
- Used React-Router for declarative routing. 
- Learned the basics of Node.js and Express, and created API endpoints to receive and return data (data is stored in JSON files, as database knowledge was a requirement at this stage).
- Additionally, the following expectations from previous projects were required: 
  - Semantic HTML, BEM methodology.
  - Flexbox, SASS, responsive and mobile-first design. 
  - Axios
